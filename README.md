## Background

Yelp is a user-driven small business directory which allows users from anywhere in the world to rate, review, and it is also an online reservation service. Due to the vast number of restaurants spread worldwide, it is very difficult to get to know the quality of a restaurant and the services they provide. Yelp provides us with reviews and ratings provided by the users and other services offered by the restaurants. In-order-to invest in a business or start a new one, one should have an idea of the reasons behind the success of the restaurant. The original yelp data set has the general details of restaurants but there is no analytics to infer customer satisfaction and the reasons behind the success of a restaurant. If the factors contributing to the success of a restaurant are known, it would be easy for future investors to make wise financial decisions easily. On this project we focus on investigating the relationship between rating, and review counts of customers to expain the restaurants yelp status.

## Main objectives or questions to answer:
 This project will try to answer the following main questions: 
*  Is there a relationship or correlation between rating and number of reviews?
*  Is pricing related to the restaurant rating? (eg. the higher the price range, the more likely it will have a higher rating)
*  What are the top-rated and lowest-rated restaurants?
*  Which city contains the highest-rated restaurants?

## Tasks:
* Identify the main questions to answer.
* Data sources: Get and store the data by using Yelp API, Google Geolocation API
  * scope of analysis: The large cities in North America and their surrounding suburban areas.
* Data cleaning: Clean the irrelevant data present in all the files and store them in a new and cleaned dataframe.
* Statistical analysis: Identify the relevant details that can be analyzed with the help of data that is already given in the dataset.
  * Identify the overall quality of the business by considering the average star rating.
  * Create a statistical summary of the dataset
  * Perform the data analysis and compare the average star rating and number of reviews of that business which identified as a sucessful restaurant.
  * Conducting coorelation and regression testing on review count vs star rating. 
  * Heat Map of Restaurant in a map - based on the average reviews and rating.
* Make ppt slides: contents to be included:

## Dataset 
This project is going to use YELP restaurant dataset among the top four largest cities in North America (New-York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Toronto), and their surrounding areas. The data is generated by using Yelp API calls and transformed to csv file so that we can apply Python Pandas to analyze the dataset.
            
     - 19995 data points(restaurants)
     - 196 cities, three state in US (New York, Illinois, California) one province in Canada (Ontario)
