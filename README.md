## Background

This respository performed analysis on Yelp's dataset, and share observable trends and insights. The dataset used a subset of Yelp's restaurants businesses, their rating, review count, and other informations. In the dataset you'll find information about restaurants across 4 main cities (New-York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Toronto) and 192 cities in metropolitan areas in united states and Canada.

Yelp is a user-driven small business directory which allows users from anywhere in the world to rate, review, and it is also an online reservation service. Due to the vast number of restaurants spread worldwide, it is very difficult to get to know the quality of a restaurant and the services they provide. Yelp provides us with reviews and ratings provided by the users and other services offered by the restaurants. In-order-to invest in a business or start a new one, one should have an idea of the reasons behind the success of the restaurant. The original yelp data set has the general details of restaurants but there is no analytics to infer customer satisfaction and the reasons behind the success of a restaurant. If the factors contributing to the success of a restaurant are known, it would be easy for future investors to make wise financial decisions easily. It would also be easy for foodies like us to know which new restaurants to give a try. On this project we focus on investigating the relationship between review counts, price, location of restaurants and ratings given by customers to help explain the restaurants yelp status.

The project is conducted in Jupyter notebook, a link is created on Jupyter Notebook Viewer, and a google slide pesentaion to showcase, and communicate the analysis report.Look the following links to see the project results:

## Main objectives or questions to answer:
 This project will try to answer the following main questions: 
*  Is there a relationship or correlation between rating and number of reviews?
*  Is pricing related to the restaurant rating? (eg. the higher the price range, the more likely it will have a higher rating)
*  Does the location of a restaurant affect its rating?
*  What are the average, above-average and below-average restaurants?
*  Which state contains the highest-rated restaurants?

## Data sources
This project used YELP restaurant dataset among the top four largest cities in North America (New-York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Toronto), and their surrounding areas. The data is generated by using Yelp API calls and transformed to csv file so that we can apply Python Pandas to analyze the dataset.
            
  - Information on 19995 restaurants
  - The data spans 4 main cities (New-York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Toronto) and 192 cities in metropolitan areas in united states and Canada.
